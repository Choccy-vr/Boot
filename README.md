# Boot

Boot is a YSWS where teenagers from around the world build their own operating systems. Participants can choose to develop a system from scratch or build upon an existing OS. Once your operating system is functional, we'll provide coins to buy some nice hardware from the shop.

Build an OS, and get hardware to run it.
