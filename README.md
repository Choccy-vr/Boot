# Boot
Boot is a hackathon where teens from around the world come together to build their own operating systems — from the ground up or from something already great.

Whether you're going completely custom with LFS or Buildroot, or remixing a distro like Ubuntu into something entirely your own, the choice is yours. 

Throughout the event, participants will make, test, and vote on each other’s OSes. Oh — and there might be some sweet prizes along the way (Maybe lol).

Put simply?
Build your OS. Get prizes.
